# Arkanoid-Breakout
I wrote an Arkanoid/Breakout game using C++ and the SFML graphics library.  Although it's very bare bones, I'm gradually adding to it, so it's not really done yet.
In addition to the above files, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed, the SFML library, and the .dll files in the files folder.
